Personal Portfolio Website (React)


This project is my personal portfolio website developed to present my skills, projects, and services in a clean and professional way. The objective was to design a modern, minimal, and fast-loading website that clearly communicates information while maintaining a smooth user experience.

The website is built using reusable React components and a well-structured layout to ensure scalability and maintainability. Special attention was given to responsiveness so the layout adapts perfectly across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

I implemented smooth scrolling navigation and interactive UI elements to create a seamless browsing experience. The design focuses on readability, spacing, and visual hierarchy so visitors can quickly understand the content without confusion.
